Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT). I recently graduated from the University of Florida (UF) with a Ph.D. in Astronomy. My main research interest is in extragalactic astronomy, covering topics such as large-scale structure, galaxy evolution, and cosmology. I have worked on detecting galaxy clusters using galaxy catalogs in optical and infrared wavelengths. Currently, I am involved in several follow-up projects for the galaxy cluster catalog I helped create. With that said, I am on the job market for 2024-2025.

Before earning my Ph.D., I also completed a master’s degree at UF. Prior to that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Physics and Astronomy from the University of Colorado at Boulder.
